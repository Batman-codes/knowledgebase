    <h1>Client B Form Submission Failure</h1>
<p><strong>status:approved</strong>
<strong>Problem</strong><br />
Client B experiences a failure during form submission, where the form hangs after clicking Submit.</p>
<p><strong>Environment</strong><br />
- Submission endpoint: /submitForm</p>
<p><strong>Steps</strong><br />
1. Attempt to submit the form.
2. Observe the console for any errors.</p>
<p><strong>Expected</strong><br />
The form should submit successfully without hanging.</p>
<p><strong>Actual</strong><br />
- The console displays a "400 Bad Request" error for the /submitForm endpoint.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong><br />
- Identify that the 'participantType' was missing in the payload, which is now mandatory.
- Implement a hotfix to add fallback logic that auto-sets <code>participantType='General'</code> if it is missing.
- Retest the form submission.</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong><br />
- After implementing the fix, form submission works correctly. The Client B team will be informed of the resolution.</p>
