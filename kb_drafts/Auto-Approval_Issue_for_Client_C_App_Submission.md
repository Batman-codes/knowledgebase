# Auto-Approval Issue for Client C App Submission

**Problem**  
App submissions for Client C are sent to the review queue instead of being auto-approved.

**Environment**  
- Client C application submission system

**Steps**  
1. Identify the configuration flag in the database.
2. Check if the flag is being overridden by default rules in the backend.
3. Verify the AutoApprove flag is being read from the correct configuration table.

**Expected**  
App submissions should be auto-approved without going through a review queue.

**Actual**  
Submissions were being sent to the review queue due to configuration issues.

**Resolution**  
- Fixed the configuration to ensure the AutoApprove flag reads from the new config table.
- Confirmed that submissions now go through without review.

**Notes**  
- Ensure ongoing monitoring of configuration settings to prevent future issues.
